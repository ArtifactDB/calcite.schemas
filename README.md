# Calcite schemas in an R package

This bundles the [calcite schemas](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/calcite-schemas) into an R package,
so that it can be easily referenced by other packages without requiring internet connectivity. 
If you're looking to do something useful with these schemas, check out the [**calcite** R package](https://github.com/ArtifactDB/calcite-R) instead.
